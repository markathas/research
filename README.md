# Research and Experiments by Mark Athas

This a place to store my ad-hoc research that does not qualify for publication on my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Athas/research) page.  There you will find works from my masters and certification programs.  

Here, I will publish research and experimental work results the emerge more from a hobbyest perspective.
